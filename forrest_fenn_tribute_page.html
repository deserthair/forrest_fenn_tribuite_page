                    <div class="life_class">
                        <h3>Birth & Childhood</h3>
                        <p>Forrest was born in Temple, Texas in 1930.</p>
                        <p>Forrest was a son of school principal. Problem was, Forrest did not have the
                            same passion for academics
                            as his father did. Forrest did, however, share the same passion with his father in enjoying
                            the great
                            outdoors. One important childhood experience that shaped Forrest’s love for exploring and
                            treasure hunting was
                            when Forrest found his first arrowhead. Forrest found the arrowhead lying in a plowed field
                            in Little Elm
                            Creek, Texas. According to Forrest, “It was a thrill that started me on a long journey of
                            adventure and
                            discovery.”</p>

                    <div class="life_class">
                        <h4>Summer Vacations</h4>
                        <p>Forrest’s family would go up to Yellowstone during the three-month break from school where they would do
                            all sorts of outdoor activities. By the age of 13, Forrest was a professional fishing guide.</p>

                    <div class="life_class">
                        <h5>Military Service</h5>
                        <p>It should not come as a surprise that Forrest did not attend college. He did though sneak into Texas A&M
                            with his friends, but that only lasted a few days. Forrest was called to the finance office, and at that
                            point he knew the gig was up, and he ran away. Without the prospect of going to college, Forrest joined
                            the Air Force as a radio mechanic. Shortly after he joined, Forrest was accepted into the pilot training 
                            program and became a fighter pilot.</p>

                        <h6>Marriage</h6>
                        <p>Forrest married his high school sweet heart, Peggy.</p>

                    <div class="life_class">
                        <h7>Vietnam</h7>
                        <p>Forrest was deployed to Vietnam as a fighter pilot, where he flied 328 combat missions. Forrest was shot
                            down twice, but evaded capture. Forrest returned to the United States and served in the Airforce for a
                            total of 20 years before retiring from the Air Force.</p>

                        <h8>Casting Bronze</h8>
                        <p>With only a $12,000 a year of retirement pay from the Air Force, Forrest knew that he had to do
                            something to supplement his income. Forrest moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and started making limited
                            edition bronze sculptures of statues he purchased from struggling artists. He would sell some for cash, and trade
                            others for Indian artifacts.</p>

                    <div class="life_class">
                        <h9>Art Dealer</h9>
                        <p>Forrest had the great idea to become an art dealer. There was one big problem though, Forrest did not
                            have any experience or education in art. Forrest faked it till he made it. He ran full color ads (rare
                            for that time), which helped get his 
                            business going. Since Forrest didn’t have a degree or title such as PhD, one time he signed NADT after
                            his name, which meant, “Not A Damn Thing.”</p>
                        <p>Forrest went on to be an eccentric and successful art dealer. He would pick up his customers from the
                            airport in a limo, and as they arrived to the gallery they would be met by his 36” alligator, Beowulf.
                            Forrest’s gallery included American Indian Artifacts, oil paintings, bronze statues, and some forgeries
                            (don’t worry, sells them as such).
                            Some of Forrest’s clientele included: former President Ford, Cher, Steve Martin, Robert Redford, Steven
                            Spielberg, and Ethel Kennedy.</p>

                        <h10 id="treasure_hunt">Cancer & Treasure Hunt</h10>
                        <p>Forrest bought a pre-historic site of San Lazaro, which makes up 160 acres of
                            land. Forrest excavated the ruins in true Indiana Jones fashion.
                            Life was good. Forrest’s art gallery was successful bringing in $6 million a year, and Forrest was
                            excavating an ancient Native American site. Unfortunately, Forrest’s life and luck seemed to be running
                            out.</p>
                        <p>In 1988 Forrest was diagnosed with cancer and was only given a 20% chance of living past three years.
                            Thinking about how to spend his last years on earth, Forrest came up with an idea. In an excerpt from
                            The Thrill of the Chase, Fenn says:
                            “Then one night, after the probability of my fate had finally hit bottom, I got an idea. It had been so
                            much fun building my collection over the decades, why not let others come searching for some of it while I’m
                            still here, and maybe continue looking for it after I’m gone?”
                            That led Forrest to accumulate the items he wanted to hide in the chest. The original plan was to die in
                            a spot in the mountains with his chest. That way, whoever found the treasure would also find him.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, Forrest’s cancer went into remission, and the plan to hide the treasure was suspended.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="life_class">
                        <h11>Treasure Hunt - Officially Launched</h11>
                        <p>In 2010, at 80 years old, Forrest decided that it was time revive the idea of hiding his treasure for
                            others to find. Forrest hid the treasure and published his first Memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, which
                            included a poem that contains 9 clues to the whereabouts of where Forrest hid his treasure.</p>
                        <p>According to Forrest, the treasure is contained in cast bronze chest weighing 42 pounds and has an
                            estimated worth of over $2 million dollars. What exactly is inside the chest to make it worth that much?
                            In his Memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, Forrest details what is in the chest.</p>
                        <ul>The Contents:
                            <li>A cast bronze chest with three-dimensional female figures on the sides and lid. It probably is a Romanesque
                                Lock Box dated to around 1150 AD, and it most likely was used to hold a family bible.</li>
                            <li>20,000 word autobiography inside a glass jar covered with wax to protect it from moisture.</li>
                            <li>Gold coins, mainly American eagles and double eagles.</li>
                            <li>Placer Nuggets from Alaska, two of which weigh over one pound and hundreds of smaller nuggets. Forrest
                                states that there is over 20 troy pounds of gold in the chest.</li>
                            <li>Pre-Columbian gold animal figures.</li>
                            <li>Ancient Chinese human faces carved from Jade.</li>
                            <li>Spanish 17th century gold ring with a large emerald that was found with a metal detector.</li>
                            <li>Antique ladies gold dragon coat bracelet that contains 254 rubies, six emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires 
                                and numerous diamonds.</li>
                            <li>Small silver bracelet made with 22 turquoise disc beads.</li>
                            <li>Tairona and Sinu Indian necklace from Columbia containing 39 animal fetishes carved from quartz
                                crystal, carnelian, jadeite, and other stones. One of the animals is a cast gold jaguar claw, along with a cast                            
                                gold frog.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>According to Forrest, “The different objects in the cache are too numerous to mention one by one,” so
                            there is a lot of items that we are unaware of.</p>
