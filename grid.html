            <p class="bio_class_article">Forrest’s childhood was anything but normal, at least to todays standards. Born
                in Temple, Texas in 1930,
                Forrest was a son of school principal. Problem was, Forrest did not have the same passion for academics
                as
                his father did. Forrest did, however, share the same passion with his father in enjoying the great
                outdoors.
                One important childhood experience that shaped Forrest’s love for exploring and treasure hunting was
                when
                Forrest found his first arrowhead. Forrest found the arrowhead lying in a plowed field in Little Elm
                Creek,
                Texas. According to Forrest, “It was a thrill that started me on a long journey of adventure and
                discovery.”
                Source: https://www.oldsantafetradingco.com/
                Forrest’s family would go up to Yellowstone during the three-month break from school where they would do
                all
                sorts of outdoor activities. By the age of 13, Forrest was a professional fishing guide.
                In Forrest’s memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, Forrest tells stories of getting lost in the mountains
                with a
                friend at 16, and catching a buffalo and tying it to a car, among many, many other fun and interesting
                stories. If you are interested in reading more about his childhood, and the rest of his life, you can

                Military Service &Vietnam
                It should not come as a surprise that Forrest did not attend college. He did though sneak into Texas A&M
                with his friends, but that only lasted a few days. Forrest was called to the finance office, and at that
                point he knew the gig was up, and he ran away.
                Without the prospect of going to college, Forrest joined the Air Force as a radio mechanic. Shortly
                after he
                joined, Forrest was accepted into the pilot training program and became a fighter pilot. During this
                time,
                Forrest married his high school sweet heart, Peggy.
                Forrest was deployed to Vietnam as a fighter pilot, where he flied 328 combat missions. Forrest was shot
                down twice, but evaded capture. Forrest returned to the United States and served in the Airforce for a
                total
                of 20 years before retiring from the Air Force.
                Art Dealer
                With only a $12,000 a year of retirement pay from the Air Force, Forrest knew that he had to do
                something to
                supplement his income. Forrest moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and started making limited edition bronze
                sculptures of statues he purchased from struggling artists. He would sell some for cash, and trade
                others
                for Indian artifacts.
                Forrest had the great idea to become an art dealer. There was one big problem though, Forrest did not
                have
                any experience or education in art.
                Forrest faked it till he made it. He ran full color ads (rare for that time), which helped get his
                business
                going. Since Forrest didn’t have a degree or title such as PhD, one time he signed NADT after his name,
                which meant, “Not A Damn Thing.”
                Forrest went on to be an eccentric and successful art dealer. He would pick up his customers from the
                airport in a limo, and as they arrived to the gallery they would be met by his 36” alligator, Beowulf.
                Forrest’s gallery included American Indian Artifacts, oil paintings, bronze statues, and some forgeries
                (don’t worry, sells them as such).
                Some of Forrest’s clientele included: former President Ford, Cher, Steve Martin, Robert Redford, Steven
                Spielberg, and Ethel Kennedy.

                Cancer – Forrest’s Reason for the Hunt
                During this whole time, Forrest bought the pre-historic site of San Lazaro, which makes up 160 acres of
                land. Forrest continued to excavate the ruins in true Indiana Jones fashion.
                Life was good. Forrest’s art gallery was successful bringing in $6 million a year, and Forrest was
                excavating an ancient Native American site. Unfortunately, Forrest’s life and luck seemed to be running
                out.
                In 1988 Forrest was diagnosed with cancer and was only given a 20% chance of living past three years.
                Thinking about how to spend his last years on earth, Forrest came up with an idea. In an excerpt from
                The
                Thrill of the Chase, Fenn says:
                “Then one night, after the probability of my fate had finally hit bottom, I got an idea. It had been so
                much
                fun building my collection over the decades, why not let others come searching for some of it while I’m
                still here, and maybe continue looking for it after I’m gone?”
                That led Forrest to accumulate the items he wanted to hide in the chest. The original plan was to die in
                a
                spot in the mountains with his chest. That way, whoever found the treasure would also find him.
                Fortunately,
                Forrest’s cancer went into remission, and the plan to hide the treasure was suspended.
                In 2010, at 80 years old, Forrest decided that it was time revive the idea of hiding his treasure for
                others
                to find. Forrest hid the treasure and published his first Memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, which
                included a
                poem that contains 9 clues to the whereabouts of where Forrest hid his treasure.
                What is in the Treasure Chest?
                According to Forrest, the treasure is contained in cast bronze chest weighing 42 pounds and has an
                estimated
                worth of over $2 million dollars. What exactly is inside the chest to make it worth that much? In his
                Memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, Forrest details what is in the chest.
                The Contents
                -A cast bronze chest with three-dimensional female figures on the sides and lid. It probably is a
                Romanesque
                Lock Box dated to around 1150 AD, and it most likely was used to hold a family bible.
                -20,000 word autobiography inside a glass jar covered with wax to protect it from moisture.
                -Gold coins, mainly American eagles and double eagles.
                -Placer Nuggets from Alaska, two of which weigh over one pound and hundreds of smaller nuggets. Forrest
                states that there is over 20 troy pounds of gold in the chest.
                -Pre-Columbian gold animal figures.
                -Ancient Chinese human faces carved from Jade.
                -Spanish 17th century gold ring with a large emerald that was found with a metal detector.
                -Antique ladies gold dragon coat bracelet that contains 254 rubies, six emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires,
                and
                numerous diamonds.
                -Small silver bracelet made with 22 turquoise disc beads.
                -Tairona and Sinu Indian necklace from Columbia containing 39 animal fetishes carved from quartz
                crystal,
                carnelian, jadeite, and other stones. One of the animals is a cast gold jaguar claw, along with a cast
                gold
                frog.
                -According to Forrest, “The different objects in the cache are too numerous to mention one by one,” so
                there
                is a lot of items that we are unaware of.

                Clues
                Where exactly did Forrest hide his treasure, and what clues did he leave behind?
                In his Memoir, Forrest, “wrote a poem containing nine clues that if followed precisely, will lead to the
                end
                of my rainbow and treasure:
                As I have gone alone in there,
                And with my treasures bold,
                I can keep my secret where,
                And hint of riches new and old.

                Begin it where warm waters halt
                And take it in the canyon down,
                Not far, but too far to walk.
                Put in below the home of Brown.

                From there it’s no place for the meek,
                The end is ever drawing nigh;
                There’ll be no paddle up your creek,
                Just heavy loads and water high.

                If you’ve been wise and found the blaze,
                Look quickly down, your quest to cease,
                But tarry scant with marvel gaze,
                Just take the chest and go in peace.

                So why is it that I must go
                And leave my trove for all to seek?
                The answers I already know,
                I’ve done it tired, and now I’m weak.

                So hear me all and listen good,
                Your effort will be worth the cold.
                If you are brave and in the wood
                I give you title to the gold.”

                Unfortunately, Forrest did not reveal what the nine clues are, except for the first one, which is Begin
                it
                where warm waters halt.
                Forrest later revealed in his second book a map (see below) of where the treasure is located.
                There are several other clues that Forrest has given over the past years. To get a full list and
                breakdown
                of what those clues are, visit our other article here.

                Map
                Originally, Forrest only said that the treasure was hid north of Santa Fe, New Mexico. But, in 2013 in
                his
                second memoir, Too Far to Walk, Forrest published a map that had written in the top right corner,
                “Forrest
                Fenn’s hidden treasure is somewhere to be found within the highlighted region of the Rocky Mountains on
                this
                map.”
                IMAGE OF MAP
                The treasure is located somewhere on that map, all you have to do is decipher the poem to lead you right
                to
                it? Easy enough right?
                Conspiracies
                One question that will inevitably come across anyone’s mind Forrest Fenn’s treasure is, “does this
                treasure
                even exist?” To some, the goodwill of someone to purposefully hide a treasure worth $2 million for some
                stranger to find is too good to be true.
                Forrest hid the treasure alone because he explains, “two people can keep a secret if one of them is
                dead.”
                While Forrest showed the treasure to a few friends before he hid it, he was the only one there when the
                treasure was hidden.
                Source: BOOK
                The second question that comes across everyone’s mind is, “is the treasure still out there?” Many
                treasure
                hunters have claimed to have found the treasure or claim to know of the location. But, no one has shown
                any
                enough evidence that they are in possession of the treasure.
                There could be someone who has found the treasure but has chosen to remain anonymous. For example,
                recently
                there has been a man from Albuquerque who claims to have found the location of the treasure, but it is
                not
                there because someone must have taken it.

                Whether it is real, or not, still out there, or found, we may never know.

                Controversies/Deaths in the Hunt
                Since the hunt has begun in 2010, there has been four confirmed deaths related to different people
                hunting
                for the treasure. These deaths have sparked many to call to an end to the search, which Forrest has
                decided
                to let the search live on.
                Randy Bilyeu, January 2016
                Randy and his dog, Leo, took off down the Rio Grande River in New Mexico with a raft in January with
                snow on
                the ground. After nine days rescue teams were called in to try to locate Randy. The raft along with the
                dog
                were found (the dog was alive), but Randy was nowhere to be found. Seven months later remains of Randy
                were
                found.

                with a raft. His raft flipped over and his friends could not save him. It took his friends 10 days to
                report
                the accident. Eric’s body was found approximately a month later. He most likely died by drowning.
                There have been suspicions that Eric found the treasure and that his friends took the treasure and split
                it
                among themselves. But that is just a conspiracy at this point.

                Whenever you go out into the wilderness you run the risk of encountering wild animals and bad weather.
                Make
                sure that you always take a buddy and that you have the proper food, water, and gear. Always tell
                someone
                where you are going.
                If you decide to look for the treasure, please, be safe! Here are some resources on safety in the
                wilderness

                Making the Trek
                Personally, I have gone looking for the treasure 6 different times around Crestone, Colorado. That area
                of
                wilderness is truly a hidden gem. I promise you that if you tell someone you are going on a treasure
                hunt
                they will look excited for you but confused at the same time because who does that? Searching for
                treasure
                truly is a rush and I have made several memories with each person that I went with.

                Remember, the hunt is supposed to be fun! I would recommend planning a separate activity not involving
                the
                treasure hunt so that if you do not find the treasure you have something else to distract from your
                disappointment.
                Happy hunting, and be safe!</p>
